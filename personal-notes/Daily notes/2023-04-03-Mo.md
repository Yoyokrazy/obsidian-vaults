### Pre Standup
-  iteration planning meeting
- issues w pull creating a million commits which is annoying
	- [[git flows]] from julia might solve? 
	- lol no this is just what I normally do, but least its documented now
- trying to figure out how the hell to dispose of my delay without triggering the callback

--- 
### Post Standup
- okay so it's specifically something related to when an actual workspace edit is returned. Not sure exactly what that means for me
- just talked with Peng
	- "bug" is okay to ignore. still not 110% confident that the second trigger of `didChange` is cool, but the notebook doesn't end up dirty.
	- talked a bit about work/life balance and keeping up with the surrounding product space.
	- especially with copilot getting better and everything, I don't as much need to be a whiz programmer. It's becoming incredibly important to dogfood and have the ideas about what a consumer would want. There will always be people that can implement it, but focus on the ideas and functionality.
