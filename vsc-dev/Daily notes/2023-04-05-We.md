- UX call was shadowed
- got in way late
- finish PR

--- 
- For standup:
	- Finalized PR for the `attachmentCleaner`, using the finalized `onWillSaveNotebookDocument`
	- Demo:
		- show initial state (edit the image then immediately save)
		- uncomment the onSave code, show the working state
	- Sat in on UX meeting 
	- starting to refamiliarize with jupyter codebase, as I'll be working in there for the kernel commands

--- 
- (re)learn how to [[change terminal command names]] for things like `code-insiders .` --> `ci .`
- ok lets start to get into jupyter
- [ ] todo I'm theoretically supposed to build an extension... what should I do
- [ ] todo start to check out openAI code examples that use jupyter
- starting to see how the base `Jupyter.restartKernel` command works
