- [x] finish [Add support for attachment cleaning on notebook save by Yoyokrazy Â· Pull Request #179169 Â· microsoft/vscode Â· GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/179169) once Peng merges updates to api
	- this will require shifting from using the proposed api to just leveraging the native api within `vscode.d.ts` 
	- also some  names changed, ex: document -> notebook, etc.
