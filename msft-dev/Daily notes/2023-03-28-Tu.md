- slow morning, dealing w personal admin things (court call etc.)
- 1:1 with Kai
	- talked about the work for near future (referenced in near-term [[planning]])
	- [[notebookWillSave API]] integration into [[notebookAttachmentCleaner]]
		- ***TODO***: talk with Peng re: Q below
		- Q -- If we are using the `onWillSave`  (explicit ctrl-s), what happens when the user is only using autosave?
			- also implement `onWillClose` to cover for autosave people?
			- what if they neither save nor close their document... Is there a time range?
			- Just keep on using the debounced `onDidChangeTextDoc`?
	- [[notebook.codeActionsOnSave]]
		- list of user adjustable actions that happen just before save
		- integrate with `formatOnSave`
		- features:
			- notebook specific features
				- move all imports to top
				- delete empty cells
				- ??? probably need more
			- language server has things?
			- linting?
	- kernel management (see [[Kernel restart + Run work]])
		- currently have `restart` and `run all/run above` as separate functions
		- need to combine the two of them
		- UX for that maybe
- Did obsidian setup, now notetaking is FANCY
	- still need to do more with that.
	- want to able to make a task/todo item inline, and have it auto populate into a separate note with all of my todo items
