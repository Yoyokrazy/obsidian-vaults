- working on functionality for restart + run all
	- thinking about async stuff and when to await/catch
- couple meetings and chats about files and type mapping refactors
	- couple updates within the [[Kernel restart + Run commands]] notes under today's date
- classic feelings of inadequacy during standup :)
