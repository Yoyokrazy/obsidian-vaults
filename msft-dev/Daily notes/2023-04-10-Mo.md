- read through *most* of the jupyter repo docs
	- understand most things, but some of the more complicated messaging protocols are a bit confusing. 
	- might still want to meet w peng to discuss whether or not my ideas are correct
- replace two different restart ID's with generic, 
	- edit `package.json ` -> when clase
- '...' for command with further action
	- we throw a dialog

- For Standup
	- Spent a couple days familiarizing myself with the jupyter repo and the docs
	- Met w Peng to discuss the restartKernel command(s)
		- seems like a refactor could be good, two commands with identical implementation within  `notebookCommandListener.ts`
		- just different when clauses within `package.json` (so refactor and then clean this up for clarity)
	- change `restartKernel` to return a promise, allowing run all and run above to trigger after the kernel restarts
	- thinking about language for `Restart and run above` VS `Restart and run up to Selected Cell`
		- the latter is used by jupyter labs
		- run above seems odd, because might not run the focused cell (when would a user want this?)

- start commenting out old [[Kernel restart + Run commands]] 
- yeah finished things up, had to change some of the enablements, and got everything running under `jupyter/restartkernel`
- put up a PR + merged --> [refactor multiple RestartKernel commands into single, under Jupyter category by Yoyokrazy · Pull Request #13297 · microsoft/vscode-jupyter · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/pull/13297) 
- [x] todo add `Promise` to [notebookCommandListener.ts --> restartKernel()](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/mlively/restartAndRun/src/notebooks/notebookCommandListener.ts#L168) to allow restart + run to wait for completed restart ✅ 2023-04-10
- [x] todo actually implement the restart+Run commands -- see context in [[Kernel restart + Run commands]] ✅ 2023-04-12
- [ ] clean up obsidian tasks into something a bit more useful (maybe setup some tags to sort them? priority levels?)
- [ ] #kernel think about language for    `Restart and Run Above`   --vs--   `Restart and Run up to Selected Cell`
- [ ]
