### Pre-Standup
- biked into work
	- fucking lost a bolt on my shoe
	- FIXED -- thanks bike shop for that $1 bolt
- HR modules thru viva
- discuss w Peng re: debounce textChange vs willSave
	- notes within [[notebookAttachmentCleaner]] 
	- rework the debouncer to include a cancellation functionality
	- change `cleanNotebookAttachments()` to just return the workspace edit rather than applying it within the function
	- if didChange + debounce
		- call fxn and immediately apply the edit
	- if willSave
		- CANCEL the debounce (need reimplementation of debounce)
		- return the workspace edit for [[notebookWillSave API]]
		- this ensures the notebook will never be dirty after an explicit save
- STANDUP
--- 
### Post Standup
- okay wow. the debouncer simply did not work. updated to delayer, works now.
- using `delayer.dispose()` cancels the delay, so will call this upon `willSaveNoteDoc`
	- working
- changed the structure of `cleanNotebookAttachments` to just return a notebook edit for that cell
	- if called by `onDidChangeNotebookDoc`, just convert the notebook edit directly into a Workspace Edit, and then apply it.
	- if called by `onWillSaveNotebookDoc` then iterate through all md cells of the notebook, create an array of `notebookEdit[]`, put that into a `workspaceEdit`, and then resolve the `waitUntil` with that. ***TODO^***
