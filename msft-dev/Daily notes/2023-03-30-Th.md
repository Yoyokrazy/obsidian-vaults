### Pre Standup
- biked again, sore legs
- notification catch up
- cleaned up profiles in vsc
- time to test the `waitUntil` + resolve that I wrapped up yesterday
- REMEMBER TO UTILIZE EXTENSION EXAMPLES
- [[Drag n Drop]]
	- started work on this, there's a PR up in draft, but probably want to just restart as it's about 7000 commits behind...
	- keep the old PR open til the new code is written
- `willSave` Functionality within [[notebookAttachmentCleaner]]
	- seems like disposal is a bit funky. if you dispose within the `waitUntil`, then it doesn't actually do it... maybe need to figure this out
	- overall seems to be working okayish

### Post Standup
- CAAAAAAAKE
- PARTAYYY
- delays givin me trouble
