### Near-term
- Notebook Save participants
	- `onWillSaveNotebookDocument` API finalization @rebornix
	- Adoption ^^ in notebook `ipynb.attachmentCleaner` @Yoyokrazy
	- Support for [[notebook.codeActionsOnSave]] @Yoyokrazy
- Missing common kernel management commands (Restart + run all, Restart + run above) @Yoyokrazy [[Kernel restart + Run commands]]
- keyboard shortcuts like `ctrl+/` for notebook specific contexts, like commenting out multiple cells at a time

### Long-term
- yeah I've got no idea.
- become more knowledgeable

- can't use latex math in non-md cells (aka widget or something)
	- could be cool? not sure. markdown renderer? no clue bout the scope
- Drag and Drop images into md cells (assigned to me, but just stretch for this iteration)
